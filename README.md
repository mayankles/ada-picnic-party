My dog Ada and I are turning about the same age this year, so it felt like a good excuse to throw a party!

I've reserved a picnic shelter at Black Hill Regional Park, and I'll provide food and drinks and such (alcohol is not allowed at this type of picnic shelter, womp womp).  There's also a dog park close to the picnic areas, so we can take the doggos to play in there if there's enough demand!
